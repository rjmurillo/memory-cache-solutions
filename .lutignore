## The .lutignore file is used by Live Unit Testing to ignore Visual Studio temporary files, build results,
## and files generated by popular Visual Studio add-ons when creating a private copy of the source tree that
## Live Unit Testing uses for its build.
##
## This file has same format as git's .gitignore file (https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore). In fact, in the
## case where a .lutignore file is not found, but a .gitignore file is found, Live Unit Testing will use the
## .gitignore file directly for the above purpose.

## Any files that are needed for the build, that are not generated during the build itself need to be copied over.
## This .lutignore copies over all of the files, including .dll, .exe, .pdb to the private copy of the source tree.
##
## This ensures that .exe files checked into the git repository or .exe files that are added to the repository
## during repository initialization/setup are also present in Live Unit Testing's private copy.
